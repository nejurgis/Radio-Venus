# Radio Venus

> An astrological music discovery tool. Enter your birthday, find where Venus was when you were born, and hear music from artists who share your Venus sign placement.

## What this is

Radio Venus maps musicians by their natal Venus position — the astrological placement that governs aesthetic sensibility, beauty, and taste. Users enter their date of birth, the app calculates their Venus sign using astronomical ephemeris data, and returns a curated stream of musicians who share the same placement. Music is served via YouTube embeds.

## How it works

- User inputs date of birth
- App calculates Venus position (sign, degree, decan) using astronomy-engine
- Matches against a curated database of musicians with verified birth data
- User can filter by musical genre/subgenre
- Returns matched musicians with embedded YouTube playback

- Venus in Libra: harmonious, elegant, balanced
- Venus in Scorpio: intense, underground, transformative

- Venus in Capricorn: structured, austere, timeless
- Venus in Aquarius: experimental, futuristic, avant-garde
- Venus in Pisces: ethereal, ambient, devotional
